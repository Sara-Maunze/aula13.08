Aula de iniciacao ao Github


GitHub is a Git repository web-based hosting service which offers all of the functionality of Git as well as adding many of its own features. Unlike Git, which is strictly a command-line tool, GitHub provides a web-based graphical interface and desktop as well as mobile integration. It also provides access control and several collaboration features such as wikis, task management, and bug tracking and feature requests for every project.[3]

GitHub offers both paid plans for private repositories, and free accounts, which are usually used to host open source software projects. As of 2014, GitHub reports having over 3.4 million users,making it the largest code host in the world.

GitHub has become such a staple among the open-source development community that many developers have begun considering it a replacement for a conventional resume and some employers require applicants to provide a link to and have an active contributing GitHub account in order to qualify for a job.
